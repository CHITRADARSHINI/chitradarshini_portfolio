        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <p>During my internship at Siemens Advanta, I worked on a 3D printing error detection project, where I developed a Python
            algorithm to automatically identify defects in printed objects. The system captured photos from multiple angles and analyzed
            the prints using image processing techniques to detect issues. By comparing these images to a pre-existing database, it
            ensured accurate detection of even subtle anomalies. This project significantly improved quality control and minimized
            material waste in the 3D printing process.</p>
